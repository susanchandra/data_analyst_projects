# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using real-world e-commerce transactional data from the **Online Retail II** dataset. The objective is to help businesses identify high-value customers and optimize their marketing and retention strategies.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Online Retail II Dataset (UK-based)
- **Path**: `C:\Users\susan\Downloads\archive (9)\online_retail_II.csv`

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `XGBoost`
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔑 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing Customer IDs, canceled transactions, invalid quantities/prices.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Computed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), AOV (Average Order Value).
3. **Model Building**: Trained models using Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated models using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score.
5. **Feature Importance**: Analyzed feature contributions to model predictions.
6. **Output Generation**: Saved final predictions to CSV.

## 📦 Deliverables
- `Customer_Lifetime_Value_Prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete workflow.
- `Predicted_CLV.csv` – Output file with predicted CLV for customers.
- Final Report (2-page PDF summary).
