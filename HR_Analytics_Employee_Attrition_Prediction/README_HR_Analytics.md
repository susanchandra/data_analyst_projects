# HR Analytics — Employee Attrition Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict Employee Attrition using machine learning classification models based on IBM's HR Analytics dataset. The objective is to provide insights that can help HR departments in identifying employees who are likely to leave.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset
- **Path**: `C:\Users\susan\Downloads\archive (10)\WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔑 Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning (removed irrelevant columns)
2. Feature Engineering (Label Encoding of categorical variables)
3. Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

## 📦 Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook (`HR_Analytics_Employee_Attrition_Prediction.ipynb`)
- 2-Page Final Report (PDF)
